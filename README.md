# Jinaga

End-to-end application state management framework.

Add Jinaga.JS to a client app and point it at a Replicator.
Updates are sent to the Replicator as the user works with the app.
Any changes that the app needs are pulled from the Replicator.

## Install

Install Jinaga.JS from the NPM package.

```bash
npm i jinaga
```

This installs just the client side components.
See [jinaga.com](https://jinaga.com) for details on how to use them.

## Running a Replicator

A Jinaga front end connects to a device called a Replicator.
The Jinaga Replicator is a single machine in a network.
It stores and shares facts.
To get started, create a Replicator of your very own using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).

```
docker pull jinaga/jinaga-replicator
docker run --name my-replicator -p8080:8080 jinaga/jinaga-replicator
```

This creates and starts a new container called `my-replicator`.
The container is listening at port 8080 for commands.
Configure Jinaga to use the replicator:

```typescript
import { JinagaBrowser } from "jinaga";

export const j = JinagaBrowser.create({
  httpEndpoint: "http://localhost:8080/jinaga"
});
```

## Breaking Changes

If you are upgrading from an older version, you may need to update your code.

### Changes in version 4.0.0

In version 4.0.0, the server side code has been moved to a separate package.
This allows you to build a client using Create React App and connect it to a Replicator.

When upgrading, take the following steps:
- Install the `jinaga-server` package.
- Remove the 'jinaga' alias from 'webpack.config.js'.
- Import `JinagaServer` from 'jinaga-server'.
- Rename any references of `Specification<T>` to `SpecificationOf<T>`, and `Condition<T>` to `ConditionOf<T>`. These are used as return types of specification functions. It is uncommon to be explicit about them.

### Changes in version 3.1.0

The name of the client-side script changed from `jinaga.js` to `jinaga-client.js`.
In `webpack.config.js`, update the `jinaga` alias from `jinaga/dist/jinaga` to `jinaga/dist/jinaga-client`.

### Changes in version 3.0.0

In version 3 of Jinaga.JS, the `has` function takes two parameters.
The second is the name of the predecessor type.
In version 2, the function took only one parameter: the field name.

To upgrade, change this:

```javascript
function assignmentUser(assignment) {
  ensure(assignment).has("user");
  return j.match(assignment.user);
}
```

To this:

```javascript
function assignmentUser(assignment) {
  ensure(assignment).has("user", "Jinaga.User");
  return j.match(assignment.user);
}
```

## Build

To build Jinaga.JS, you will need Node 16.

```bash
npm ci
npm run build
npm test
```

## Release

To release a new version of Jinaga.JS, bump the version number, create and push a tag,
and create a release. The GitHub Actions workflow will build and publish the package.

```bash
git c main
git pull
npm version patch
git push --follow-tags
gh release create v$(node -p "require('./package.json').version") --generate-notes --verify-tag
```
