# Documentation Structure and Standards

## Overview
The `/docs` folder contains comprehensive documentation for the GameHub project, organized into logical sections for different types of documentation and audiences.

## Documentation Structure

### `/docs/plans/` - Implementation Plans ‚≠ê **CRITICAL**
**Purpose**: Markdown files containing implementation plans, project roadmaps, and phased work breakdowns.

**Key Requirements**:
- ‚úÖ **MUST contain checklists and phased work breakdowns**
- ‚úÖ **MUST include progress tracking and status indicators**
- ‚úÖ **MUST outline prerequisites and dependencies**
- ‚úÖ **MUST NOT contain source code or implementation details**
- ‚úÖ **MUST focus on planning, coordination, and project management**

**Content Guidelines**:
- Use checkboxes (`- [ ]` and `- [x]`) for task tracking
- Include phase-by-phase breakdowns with clear objectives
- Document prerequisites and system requirements
- Track completion status with visual indicators (‚úÖ, ‚ùå, üîÑ)
- Include progress summaries and current status
- Focus on "what" and "when" rather than "how"

**Example Structure**:
```markdown
# Project Implementation Plan

## Progress Summary
- ‚úÖ **Phase 1: Foundation** - COMPLETED
- üîÑ **Phase 2: Core Features** - IN PROGRESS

- [x] Set up version control
```

### `/docs/prds/` - Product Requirements Documents
**Purpose**: Detailed product requirements documents that define feature specifications, user stories, and functional requirements.

**Content Types**:
- Product feature specifications
- User experience flows and wireframes
- Functional requirements and acceptance criteria
- User story definitions
- Feature prioritization and scope
- Non-functional requirements (performance, security, etc.)

**Content Guidelines**:
- Focus on "what" the product should do, not "how" to implement it
- Include user personas and use cases
- Define clear acceptance criteria
- Document edge cases and error scenarios
- Include mockups or wireframes when helpful
- Reference related technical documentation

### `/docs/models/` - Data Model Documentation
**Purpose**: Visual and textual documentation of data models, entity relationships, and domain models.

**Content Types**:
- Entity relationship diagrams (DOT files, PlantUML, etc.)
- Data model specifications
- Domain model documentation
- Database schema documentation
- Jinaga fact model diagrams
- Entity relationship mappings

**Content Guidelines**:
- Use standard diagram formats (DOT, PlantUML, Mermaid)
- Include clear entity definitions
- Document relationships and cardinality
- Show inheritance and composition patterns
- Include version history for model changes
- Reference related implementation code

### `/docs/architecture/` - Technical Architecture
**Purpose**: Detailed technical documentation, system architecture, and design decisions.

**Content Types**:
- System architecture diagrams and descriptions
- Technical design decisions and rationale
- Component interaction patterns
- Data flow documentation
- Performance considerations

### `/docs/getting-started/` - User Guides
**Purpose**: Step-by-step guides for users and developers to get started with the project.

**Content Types**:
- Installation and setup instructions
- Quick start guides
- Tutorials and walkthroughs
- Configuration guides
- Troubleshooting documentation

### `/docs/setup/` - Setup and Configuration
**Purpose**: Detailed setup instructions and configuration documentation.

**Content Types**:
- Environment setup guides
- Configuration file documentation
- Deployment instructions
- Environment-specific setup
- Advanced configuration options

## Documentation Standards

### File Naming Convention
- Use UPPERCASE with underscores for plan files: `PROJECT_NAME_PLAN.md`
- Use UPPERCASE with underscores for PRD files: `FEATURE_NAME_PRD.md`
- Use lowercase with hyphens for guides: `getting-started-guide.md`
- Use descriptive names for model files: `domain-model.dot`, `entity-relationships.puml`
- Use descriptive, clear names that indicate content type

### Markdown Formatting
- Use consistent heading hierarchy (H1 for title, H2 for major sections, etc.)
- Include table of contents for longer documents
- Use code blocks with language specification
- Include links to related documentation
- Use badges and status indicators for progress tracking

### Content Organization
- Start with an overview or summary
- Include prerequisites when applicable
- Break complex topics into logical sections
- Include examples and code snippets where helpful
- End with next steps or related resources

### Version Control
- Keep documentation in sync with code changes
- Update plans as phases are completed
- Maintain accurate status indicators
- Archive completed plans rather than deleting them

## Important Notes

1. **Plans vs Implementation**: Plans in `/docs/plans/` should focus on project management, coordination, and tracking. Implementation details belong in code comments, architecture docs, or getting-started guides.

2. **PRDs vs Technical Specs**: PRDs in `/docs/prds/` should focus on user experience and functional requirements. Technical implementation details belong in architecture docs or code comments.

3. **Model Documentation**: Models in `/docs/models/` should focus on data relationships and domain concepts. Implementation details belong in code comments or architecture docs.

4. **Status Tracking**: Always maintain accurate status indicators and progress summaries in plan files.

5. **Cross-References**: Documentation should reference related files but not duplicate content across different types of docs.

6. **Maintenance**: Update documentation as work progresses and features are completed.

7. **Clarity**: All documentation should be clear enough for team members to understand what needs to be done and track progress effectively.

8. **Maintenance**: Update plan files as work progresses and phases are completed.

9. **Clarity**: Plans should be clear enough for team members to understand what needs to be done and track progress effectively.
