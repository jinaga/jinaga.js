### Updated Details for Issue #152

1. **Client Recovery Process**:
   - In case of a mismatch, the client should abandon its current `GraphSerializer` and create a new one. This ensures that the client can recover gracefully from a hash mismatch without requiring a full re-upload of all predecessors.

2. **Error Code for Mismatches**:
   - The replicator should return a specific HTTP status code (e.g., `409 Conflict`) when the starting hash does not match its stored final hash. This provides clear guidance to the client about the need to reset the stream.

3. **Session-Based Hashing Advantages**:
   - The state-based hashing mechanism eliminates the need for a session-specific graph ID, streamlining the protocol and reducing reliance on external session management.

4. **Streaming Use Case**:
   - This protocol aligns well with streaming scenarios, allowing facts to be sent incrementally and processed in real-time by the replicator.
