# Comprehensive Test-Driven Implementation Plan: Specification Intersection Design

## Overview

This implementation plan delivers the specification intersection solution for GitHub issue #149 through a systematic 5-phase, test-driven approach spanning both jinaga.js and jinaga-server repositories.

**Total Timeline**: 7-9 weeks
**Core Innovation**: Mathematical specification intersection eliminates runtime authorization checks, preventing 403 errors by pre-computing user-specific feeds with embedded distribution conditions.

---

## Phase 1: Core Specification Intersection Algorithm (jinaga.js)

### Phase 1.1: Foundation Algorithm Implementation
**Timeline**: Week 1-2 | **Project**: jinaga.js

#### Objectives
Implement core `intersectSpecificationWithDistributionRule()` method that mathematically combines specifications with distribution rules.

#### Implementation Tasks
1. Add `intersectSpecificationWithDistributionRule(specification, distributionRule)` method to [`DistributionEngine`](../jinaga.js/src/distribution/distribution-engine.ts)
2. Implement algorithm:
   - Add distribution user as new given
   - Create existential condition from distribution rule
   - Add path condition equating projected user with distribution user
3. Add comprehensive unit tests

#### Test Requirements
```javascript
describe('intersectSpecificationWithDistributionRule', () => {
  it('adds distribution user given to specification', () => {
    // Test that new given is added with correct type
  });
  
  it('creates existential condition from distribution rule', () => {
    // Test condition structure and logic
  });
  
  it('adds path condition equating users', () => {
    // Test user equivalence constraint
  });
  
  it('preserves original specification semantics when condition satisfied', () => {
    // Test mathematical correctness
  });
  
  it('returns empty results when distribution condition fails', () => {
    // Test graceful failure behavior
  });
});
```

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Method correctly adds distribution user given
- [ ] Existential condition properly structured with distribution rule
- [ ] Path condition correctly equates projected and distribution users
- [ ] All unit tests pass with 100% code coverage
- [ ] Method handles edge cases (empty specs, invalid rules)

#### Risk Assessment
- **Risk**: Complex existential condition logic
- **Mitigation**: Extensive unit testing with edge cases
- **Rollback**: Feature flag for algorithm enable/disable

---

### Phase 1.2: Feed Integration Method
**Timeline**: Week 2-3 | **Project**: jinaga.js

#### Objectives
Implement `intersectDistributionRules()` method that processes all distribution rules for a given specification.

#### Implementation Tasks
1. Add `intersectDistributionRules(specification, distributionUser)` method
2. Implement logic:
   - Find all feeds of input specification
   - Find matching distribution rules for each feed skeleton
   - Compute intersection for each matching rule
   - Return distinct intersected feeds
3. Add integration tests

#### Test Requirements
```javascript
describe('intersectDistributionRules', () => {
  it('finds all feeds for input specification', () => {
    // Test feed discovery logic
  });
  
  it('matches distribution rules to feed skeletons', () => {
    // Test rule matching algorithm
  });
  
  it('computes intersections for all matching rules', () => {
    // Test batch intersection processing
  });
  
  it('returns distinct intersected feeds', () => {
    // Test deduplication logic
  });
  
  it('handles specifications with no matching rules', () => {
    // Test empty result case
  });
});
```

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Method correctly identifies all relevant feeds
- [ ] Distribution rule matching works for complex specifications
- [ ] Intersection computation produces mathematically correct results
- [ ] Deduplication eliminates identical feeds
- [ ] Performance acceptable for typical rule sets (<100ms)

#### Dependencies
- Phase 1.1 must be complete and tested

## Phase 2: HTTP Layer Integration (jinaga-server)

### Phase 2.1: Feeds Endpoint Modification
**Timeline**: Week 3-4 | **Project**: jinaga-server

#### Objectives
Modify [`HttpRouter.feeds()`](src/http/router.ts) endpoint to use intersected distribution rules instead of runtime authorization checks.

#### Implementation Tasks
1. Update feeds endpoint in [`HttpRouter`](src/http/router.ts:517-544)
2. Replace current authorization logic with intersection calls
3. Cache intersected feeds with distribution user
4. Add endpoint integration tests

#### Test Requirements
```javascript
describe('HttpRouter.feeds endpoint', () => {
  it('calls intersectDistributionRules with correct parameters', () => {
    // Test method invocation
  });
  
  it('caches feeds with distribution user included', () => {
    // Test caching behavior
  });
  
  it('returns intersected feeds in correct format', () => {
    // Test response structure
  });
  
  it('handles users with no distribution rules', () => {
    // Test empty intersection case
  });
  
  it('maintains backward compatibility', () => {
    // Test existing client compatibility
  });
});
```

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Feeds endpoint successfully uses intersection method
- [ ] Feed caching includes distribution user context

#### Implementation Tasks
1. Remove `canDistributeToAll` calls from feed endpoint
2. Add distribution user verification logic
3. Ensure 403 only for actual authorization failures (user mismatch)
4. Add comprehensive endpoint tests

#### Test Requirements
```javascript
describe('HttpRouter.feed endpoint authorization', () => {
  it('verifies request user matches cached feed distribution user', () => {
    // Test user matching logic
  });
  
  it('throws Forbidden only for user mismatches', () => {
    // Test actual authorization failures
  });
  
  it('never throws Forbidden for missing starting facts', () => {
    // Test race condition resolution
  });
  
  it('maintains feed streaming for empty initial results', () => {
    // Test persistent connection behavior
  });
});
```

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] No `canDistributeToAll` calls in feed endpoint
- [ ] Distribution user verification prevents unauthorized access

  });
  
  it('retrieves feeds filtered by distribution user', () => {
    // Test cache retrieval logic
  });
  
  it('invalidates cache when distribution rules change', () => {
    // Test cache invalidation
  });
  
  it('handles multiple users with same specification', () => {
    // Test per-user caching
  });
});
```

#### Acceptance Criteria

    // Test spec handling
  });
  
  it('no longer throws Forbidden for missing starting facts', () => {
    // Test error elimination
  });
  
  it('maintains security for actual authorization violations', () => {
    // Test security preservation
  });
  
  it('works with existing authorization patterns', () => {
    // Test backward compatibility
  });
});
```
