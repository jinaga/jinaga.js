# Existential Conditions Fixes Plan

## Progress Summary

The initial implementation of existential conditions on givens (PR #135) has been completed, providing support for constraining given facts through existential conditions. During code review, four critical issues were identified that require fixes before the feature can be merged: circular reference detection, feed generation limits, enhanced error handling, and runtime execution implementation of given condition filtering. A critical finding reveals that existential conditions on givens are not implemented in the runtime execution, specifically lacking given condition filtering in the SpecificationRunner.read() method. This plan outlines the phased approach to address these issues.

## Prerequisites

- Completion of code review for PR #135
- Understanding of the specification parser and feed builder modules
- Access to existing test suites for regression testing
- Documentation of the existential conditions feature

## Phase-by-Phase Breakdown

### Phase 1: Circular Reference Detection

This phase addresses the detection and prevention of circular references in existential conditions that could lead to infinite loops during specification evaluation.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Circular reference detection algorithm implemented in specification parser
2. Error thrown when circular reference detected during parsing
3. Unit tests cover various circular reference scenarios
4. Performance impact of detection is minimal (<5% overhead)
5. Clear error messages provided for circular reference cases

### Phase 2: Feed Generation Limits

This phase implements limits on feed generation to prevent excessive resource consumption when processing complex existential conditions.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Configurable feed generation limit implemented in feed builder
2. Appropriate default limits set based on performance testing
3. Graceful degradation when limits exceeded (warning/error)
4. Monitoring/logging of feed generation metrics
5. Unit and integration tests for limit scenarios

### Phase 3: Enhanced Error Handling

This phase improves error handling throughout the existential conditions implementation for better debugging and user experience.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Comprehensive error types defined for existential condition failures
2. Detailed error messages with context information
3. Proper error propagation through the specification pipeline
4. Error recovery mechanisms where appropriate
5. Enhanced logging for debugging existential condition issues

### Phase 4: Runtime Execution Implementation

This phase addresses the critical gap in runtime execution by implementing given condition filtering in the SpecificationRunner.read() method and adding comprehensive runtime behavior tests.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Given condition filtering implemented in SpecificationRunner.read() method
2. Runtime behavior tests added covering various scenarios
3. No performance regression in specification execution
4. Backward compatibility maintained with existing specifications
5. Clear documentation of runtime behavior changes

## Detailed Testing Requirements

**Unit Testing:**
- Test circular reference detection with various nested condition scenarios
- Test feed generation limits with mock data sets of different sizes
- Test error handling for malformed existential conditions
- Test backward compatibility with existing specifications
- Test runtime execution of given condition filtering with various given scenarios

**Integration Testing:**
- End-to-end testing of specifications with existential conditions
- Performance testing under various load conditions
- Memory usage testing for large specification sets
- Cross-browser compatibility testing for web client
- Runtime behavior testing for existential conditions on givens under different execution scenarios

**Regression Testing:**
- Full test suite execution to ensure no existing functionality broken
- Edge case testing for complex nested conditions
- Stress testing with high-volume data processing
- Runtime regression testing for given condition filtering implementation

**Code Review and Validation:**
- Peer review of all fixes
- Static analysis and linting compliance
- Documentation updates for new error handling
