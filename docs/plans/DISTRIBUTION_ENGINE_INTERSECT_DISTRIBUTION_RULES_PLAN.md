# DistributionEngine intersectDistributionRules Implementation Plan

## Overview

This implementation plan delivers the `intersectDistributionRules` method for the `DistributionEngine` class, enabling mathematical specification intersection to eliminate runtime authorization checks that cause 403 Forbidden errors. This feature is part of the broader solution to GitHub issue #149, which addresses race conditions in feed authorization.

**Core Innovation**: By pre-computing user-specific feeds with embedded distribution conditions, the system eliminates runtime authorization checks that cause 403 errors, providing a mathematically elegant solution to temporal race condition problems.

2. **Performance Impact**: Complex intersection computations
   - **Mitigation**: Performance optimization, caching, early termination
   - **Rollback**: Performance monitoring, automatic fallback for slow operations

### Medium-Risk Areas
1. **Integration Complexity**: API compatibility with existing code
   - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive integration testing, backward compatibility validation
   - **Rollback**: Maintain existing API surface, add new methods alongside old ones

2. **Memory Usage**: Per-user feed caching overhead

   - **Rollback**: Disable caching, use runtime computation

## Dependencies
- **Phase 1** ‚Üí **Phase 2**: Core algorithm must be complete before feed integration
- **Phase 2** ‚Üí **Phase 3**: Integration method must be complete before comprehensive testing
- **Phase 3** ‚Üí **Phase 4**: Testing must validate correctness before performance optimization

## Notes
- This implementation is part of the broader solution to GitHub issue #149
- The intersection algorithm is mathematically complex and requires careful validation
- Performance optimization is critical for production use with large rule sets
- Integration with HTTP layer will be handled in separate jinaga-server repository work
- Feature flags should be implemented to enable gradual rollout and easy rollback
